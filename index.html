        John is a professional teacher/trainer that also “self”-taught himself coding with a little help from books, the internet, and some friends. First things first, coding is not easy if you know nothing about it. However, even after a few days someone that knew nothing about coding can create a simple webpage for themselves. The biggest problem I came across when trying to find solutions to my problems was that I was speaking a different language. Sometimes due to this barrier, I couldn't even search for solutions, because I didn't know what to say. It was very frustrating to say the least. My first language was English, and I was trying to learn from people that spoke a language I knew nothing about, code language. The first thing I needed to do was learn the language, in order to troubleshoot any problems that I had. That being said, the first thing anyone trying to learn to code, build websites, apps, etc. should do is learn the language. Once you can understand what the professionals are saying, searching for answers and troubleshooting problems becomes immensely easier. Browse through the documents section if you need help understanding some of the beginner terms. Tutorials are provided as well to help guide you through some questions you may have.
